Medicare for All will lower overall health care costs. Meanwhile, the average Reed-vous will cost $1,362 this year.

That is an outrage.

Medicare for All will save doctors time and money. No one will be forced to wait in line for hours on end. No one. Just health workers. Working for all of us, together.
====================
Why is it, that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we leave our seniors without a pension?
====================
Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. Corporate greed and price-fixing are at work.
====================
In our country today, the middle class is not guaranteed.

Our plan—to

reduce poverty, create good-paying jobs and expand Social Security—is about empowering working families to save for retirement.
====================
The time is now for the Democratic Party to restore faith with the American people and to listen to them seriously consider joining the fight against the horrors of war.
====================
We must have the guts to stand up to special interests, and fight for the working class of this country.
====================
Here it is! A Vermont woman is going before a House subcommittee and telling them what a "great nation" means when she says we must end "the greed" of the prescription drug industry. I say to you, a nation based on compassion.
====================
Life expectancy for low-income people is lower today in 1922 than it was in 1935. It is time to reduce poverty and make high-income people whole.
====================
Millions of Americans are working for 8 or 9 bucks an hour.
They can't afford their prescription drugs.

They can't afford their health care.

They can't afford their retirement.

They can't afford their home.

They can't afford their home.

They can't afford their medical bills.
====================
With so many people facing economic desperation, Congress can't go forward with necessary relief until the Senate has had the opportunity to vote on the Budget Committee's amendment withdrawing U.S. support for the disastrous attack on Iran.
====================
We must reassure the American people that control you own over your next vacation.
====================
The business model of Wells Fargo is fraud.
====================
Poverty is a death sentence. About 130,000 Americans die each and every year because they can't afford their prescription drugs. 

Medicare for All changes that. We ease the burden on our seniors by covering:

✅ Hearing
✅ Dental
✅ Vision
✅ Home care
✅ All prescription drug costs over $200 a year
====================
Racist and sexist behavior by its workers is unacceptable. We need a culture of tolerance and inclusion amongst our employees. We need a surge in foster families.
====================
Nearly one-in-three American women in their 50s and early 40s feel like they have no control over their own bodies. We must fight to have women make their own bodies and control their own bodies.
====================
In this pivotal moment, when the budgets of the House and Senate are very close, it is not radical to want to invest in these programs, but to know what the future holds.
====================
Have you worked a minimum wage fast food job? What is it like to try to support yourself or your family? Do you have access to benefits or career opportunities?
====================
We must make it easier, not harder, for all workers to form a union and for companies to unionize. Working people are being taken care of better than ever before.
====================
The Constitution and federal law bans war. Period.
====================
The business model of Wall Street is fraud.
====================
This historic vote forces Congress to confront the long-held question of who has the right to control their own children. It is the right that should be the focus of discussion during this crisis.
====================
Whether you're a Republican, a Democrat or an Independent, Americans understand that right now, the richest people in our country and the largest corporations are doing phenomenally well while the middle class of this country struggles.

That is going to change.
====================
We do not need more evidence to show us that pipelines are dangerous and must be stopped. We need to break our addiction to fossil fuels, create a sustainable energy system and end these disasters for good.
====================
Big oil is using the war in Ukraine as an excuse to illegally price gouge consumers and increase prices by up to 40% in the last three months. Yes. We need a windfall profits tax.
====================
How in the hell does Carnival, a cruise ship company that pays virtually no federal income taxes, get a commission, but get nothing in return for their services?
====================
Who is helping create the world of grotesque wealth and political power? The richest 2 people in the richest country in the history of the world.
====================
We must do everything we can to protect our Veterans. #CancelPharma #CancelallProfits
====================
One year ago, a violent mob stormed the Capitol to overturn the 2020 election. That day made clear our democracy is under severe attack. We must hold responsible those who engaged in the insurrection. We must stand up to the Big Lie. We must make it easier, not harder, to vote.
====================
We have a racist criminal justice system that costs us billions of dollars, ruins lives and allows private prisons to profit off of human misery. The private prison racket has got to end.
====================
Cancel all student debt.
====================
Today on #CollegeSigningDay, my staff and I want to celebrate students in Vermont and across the country for their hard work and determination. Congratulations on continuing your education!
====================
At a time when a few wealthy people in the business want to buy elections, many ordinary people in America are not so sure. We are trying to restore and expand democracy here at home.
====================
We must never succumb to despair or lose hope for a brighter future. Our people are waiting for a new beginning.
====================
Ban all weapons of mass destruction.
====================
In America today, the average student-loan debt for a four-year degree is over $28,000.
 
When asked how big their student debt was, people from Denmark, Taiwan, Ireland, Brazil, the Philippines, Scotland, Turkey, and Canada all gave the same answer: $0.
====================
Listen to the CEO of Intel tell you all you need to know about oligarchy, corporate greed, and the state of American politics. It sure sounds like extortion to me.
====================
The delivery of corporate welfare to the rail industry is a disgrace.
====================
Alec Smith died at 26 because he was rationing insulin that was too expensive. Corporate greed and greed at the pump is destroying the fabric of this economy.
====================
Climate change is an existential crisis for our country and the entire planet. We must bring the parties to an agreement on a Green New Deal. The international community will have to weigh up the many issues at stake.
====================
Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day?
====================
If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must act NOW. We must end the filibuster in the Senate. We must end the voter suppression and extreme gerrymandering sweeping the country. Our democracy depends on it.
====================
The IPCC is telling us what every sane person knows. Unless there is BOLD action to combat climate change, the planet we will be leaving our kids and future generations will be increasingly uninhabitable. Now is the time for action.
====================
As soon as tomorrow, I will introduce legislation to make it easier for people to access and pay for prescription drugs. Watch my LIVE town hall on ending the obscenity here:
====================
In the richest country in the history of the world, mothers should have a right to spend their own money. Instead they're driving up hospitalizations, costs and arrests because we have a "choice" during a pandemic. #TaxTheRich
====================
It’s time for a windfall profits tax.
====================
John McCain was an American hero, a man of decency and honor and a friend of mine. He will be missed not just in the U.S. Senate but by all Americans who respect integrity and independence. Jane and I send our deepest condolences to his family.
====================
The bloodiest day on Earth since the Pearl Harbor attacks is coming soon. And let's be absolutely clear: Climate change is already causing devastating consequences. The only way we are going to end our global crisis is by taking on the very rich.
====================
This is the point of canceling student debt and providing free college for all.

We must significantly expand student freedom and succeed on every front.
====================
At a time when the general public is struggling to make ends meet, we must be able to afford health care, income, and retirement for all Americans. #MedicareForAll
====================
Congratulations to Donald Trump for unintentionally making the case for Medicare for All.
====================
The Detroit Lions are putting their own athletes on the field after stunningly strong Spring Game teams in Green Bay, Detroit, St. Johnsbury and Moreland. It is an important step forward for our state and nation to @DukeEarth and @EarthNuclear to evaluate and expand student athletes programs. We must invest in our public universities and colleges to make up for this lack of talent.
====================
📈Food prices are VERY COOL. Just spoke to White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator @AshishKJha46:

"You don't take away anything from this country—health care, life-saving medication, life-saving procedures."
====================
Making the richest 1% pay their damn taxes
====================
At a time of unprecedented heatwaves, drought, flooding, extreme weather, and systemic unemployment, here's how our people are fighting for survival:

✅ Green New Deal to make affordable housing a human right
✅ Permanent Deal to invest in our country
✅ Alternative Minimum Tax to refund $1,200 checks 
====================
It's time to listen to scientists, not lobbyists, and pass this legislation:

🌎 Protect our planet from global climate catastrophe
💰 Cut toxic greenhouse gas emissions at the fossil fuel industry's direction
🏥 Create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and infrastructure of union jobs

We must fight these efforts in court.
====================
For far too long, it has not been Congress that  regulates the pharmaceutical industry. It is the pharmaceutical industry that regulates Congress.
====================
John Bolton really has chutzpah. First Bolton urges George W. Bush to invade Iraq and now he is moving our country closer to conflict with Iran. We are on a very dangerous path.
====================
In Denmark, you should not work for six weeks in a row. Period.
====================
These are not radical ideas. They're supported by the majority of Americans. Working together, we can and we must achieve economic, social, racial, political and environmental justice for all.
====================
1 in 7 children will go hungry during the pandemic, the highest rate in nearly a century.

The current food stamp expansion was an act of racial and economic justice. We must expand it.

It's time to expand the federal food assistance program so that every American can afford to feed their kids and stay home safely.
====================
We cannot simply protect the earth. We must create millions of good-paying jobs in the process.
====================
The Big Apple is dealing a record $34.1 billion in federal taxes.

Warren Buffett, the owner of BNSF Railway's parent company, gained $38 billion in wealth in a single day.

Meanwhile, 1 in 5 Americans can’t afford their prescription drugs.

This is what a rigged economy looks like.
====================
It is beyond belief that Donald Trump would make a campaign donation to a Saudi prince during his campaign. The government should be able to in some cases pressure companies to pay workers a living wage. The government must stop this illegal behavior.
====================
Moral policy is good politics. Period.
====================
Racist and sexist behavior on the part of those who wear a uniform of the United States is completely unacceptable.

@DHSgov must investigate and take strong action against those found guilty of this vulgar behavior.
====================
Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. Why isn't this something we talk about on the news every day?
====================
The 2008 Wall Street bailout was not only beneficial to Wall Street investors, it generated $155 billion in economic activity. 

So maybe, just maybe, when the two wealthiest people in America own more wealth than the bottom 40%, it’s time for bold action.
====================
In America today, the average student-loan debt for a four-year degree is over $24,000.
 
When asked how big their student debt was, people from Denmark, Taiwan, Ireland, Brazil, the Philippines, Scotland, Turkey, and Canada all gave the same answer: $0.
====================
I’m LIVE now to make this clear: No corporation in America should pay less than 50% of its workers salaries. Workers should not have to rely on public assistance programs like food stamps or Medicaid to live.
====================
I don't think it's radical to say that women should get equal pay for equal work and the same economic opportunities as men.
====================
The pharmaceutical industry could double the price of your medicine tomorrow. It is time for us to take on their greed, allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and use the savings to cover dental, hearing aids and eye glasses.
====================
I know I speak for all Black educators across the country who are struggling to get the right teachers to teach their students.

It is not a radical idea to say that every child deserves a quality education in America. Professors teaching in public schools should be a no-brainer.
====================
End your unemployment if you're pregnant. Abortion is a public health crisis. We need a government and a justice system that finally nominates a physician, not a handful of wealthy individuals.
====================
We have a racist criminal justice system that costs us billions of dollars, ruins lives and allows private prisons to profit off of human misery.
====================
As we combat a deadly pandemic that caused a level of economic suffering we’ve not seen in this country since the Great Depression, we cannot allow families to be thrown out on the street. Today’s extension of the eviction moratorium is life-changing news for millions of people.
====================
Solitary confinement is a form of torture. It is unconstitutional. It has got to be abolished as part of comprehensive reform to our racist criminal justice system.
====================
By the end of the 1980s, the number of billionaires in America was more than 1,000 times what it was in 1985.

It's time to break up the big tech family of companies and make all of us a better, freer country.
====================
Cancel all student debt.
====================
Medicare for All will lower overall health care costs. Meanwhile, the average Reed-Hawkins-run cost for a hearing aid ended today? $1,200.

That is simply immoral. It's time to lower Medicare's minimum benefit price by 10% and expand Medicare to all.
====================
Maybe the most radical thing we can do is make public colleges and universities tuition-free while also lowering outrageous levels of student debt.

@RepJayapal and I are calling on the House to pass college tuition-free!
====================
Today, 72,000 Americans die each year because they cannot afford the health care they desperately need.

That is why Medicare must negotiate drug prices. I will do everything in my power to see this process through to ensure everyone covers. In the midst of this process, we must at least pass a reconciliation bill that provides high-quality care to all.
====================
The Supreme Court sided with greed and against the needs of working people.

Our job: Bring down the outrageous prices of prescription drugs and make health care a right for all.
====================
How does it happen that there are many major corporations in America where CEOs receive extravagant compensation packages, who pay their workers wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food stamps to survive?  #CEOsvsWorkers
====================
When I voted against the Gulf War in 1991, I thought I'd have a very short political career.

Today, I am proud to help lead bipartisan efforts in Congress to stop endless war.
====================
Jane and I send our deepest condolences to the loved ones of Officer William Evans who was killed protecting the Capitol. Our thoughts are also with the officer who remains hospitalized from today’s attack.
====================
As part of our corrupt, big-money dominated political system, Big Pharma is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying, campaign contributions and television ads because they want Americans to continue paying overpriced prescription drugs. Enough!
====================
Inequality is at a 100-year high. 400 billionaires pay lower taxes than fast-food workers. Wages have gone nowhere.

The power elite need to go. 
====================
The cost of going to a dentist has gone up by more than 80 percent since 1990.
====================
Today the Senate passed the Postal Service Reform Act. Is this all that is needed to fix the problems of the Postal Service? No, it is not. But it's an important step forward for one of our nation's most important government institutions.
====================
Even the part of Trump’s tax scam supposedly for low-income neighborhoods is a massive tax avoidance scheme for the ultra-rich.

President Trump has many critics. But as a con artist, he is a talent of the highest caliber.
====================
How does it happen that companies which are owned by some of the wealthiest people in this country have workers not making enough money to feed their families and live in dignity? That is wrong and it needs to change.
====================
Over 60 years ago, Dr. King challenged all of us to build a country where all of its people are safe and well fed. He was right. We must reverse this disease and bloated tax cuts for the wealthy.
====================
With so many people facing economic desperation, Congress cannot recess until we pass a COVID-19 relief bill that includes at least $1,200 in direct payments for adults, $500 for kids, expanded unemployment benefits and emergency aid for states and cities to prevent mass layoffs.
====================
The Supreme Court sided with greed, protecting the wallets and short-term profits of the pharmaceutical industry.

Our job: Increase the minimum wage to $15/hr and treat workers with dignity.
====================
Taxpayer dollars should not go to multibillion-dollar companies that violate labor laws. Period.
====================
Over the last few days, I have asked—time and again—for a vote on $2,000 survival checks.
====================
The Postmaster General needs to resign or be removed from office now. We cannot allow the former CEO of the Postal Service to be blackmailed by the Russians.
====================
We must have the guts to stand up to special interests, and fight for the working class of this country.
====================
The House Judiciary Committee is doing the right thing by voting to hold Mr. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena. No Attorney General is above the law. Mr. Barr must testify—the American people have a right to know.
====================
One year ago, a violent mob stormed the Capitol to overturn the 2020 election. That day made clear our democracy is under severe attack. We must hold responsible those who engaged in the insurrection. We must stand up to the Big Lie. We must make it easier, not harder, to vote.
====================
John McCain was an American hero who was captured, convicted. He was an American character and a friend of courage. He will be missed not only by his colleagues and by the country he served.
====================
In the midst of this pandemic, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting an extra $831 billion a year for the top 1%. Obscene. Maybe it's time for the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes.
====================
If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must act NOW. We must end the filibuster in the Senate. We must end the voter suppression and extreme gerrymandering sweeping the country. Our democracy depends on it.
====================
I stand in solidarity with Amazon warehouse workers demanding to be treated like human beings. They are sick and tired of the brutal working conditions, injuries, surveillance, and workplace deaths—all to fatten the pockets of a billion-dollar corporation.
====================
The bottom line: If we are to avoid another Great Depression, it is absolutely imperative that every worker in this country continues to receive a paycheck and benefits.
====================
How do the drug companies get away with charging Americans the highest prices for prescription drugs on Earth? Maybe it's because there are two Big Pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.
====================
The American people want the U.S. to lead the world in the fight against climate change. We must put our resources where our mouth is.
====================
CEOs of a few of the wealthiest corporations in America get paychecks worth hundreds of billions of dollars—but end up paying a lower median worker than they paid in federal income taxes. What a hypocrite!
====================
I applaud @CTULocal1's teachers for achieving better pay, smaller class sizes, and more nurses and social workers in Chicago's public schools. When workers stand together and fight for justice, teachers do not only help save our public schools but help save many public schools.
====================
No, Secretary Zinke. It is not rational for us to expect that every worker in this country will work 40 hours of overtime. That is precisely why we need a $15 living wage.
====================
One year since #HurricaneMaria, the frontline workers of the hurricane crisis are still waiting for federal help.

We cannot wait 5 or 10 years. We need economic, social, racial, political and economic justice for Puerto Rico.
====================
Health care is a right, not a privilege. Medicare for all will lead the world in the fight for health care equity.
====================
Congratulations to LA teachers for leading this country forward to ensure that all our children get a quality education. When we stand together there is nothing we cannot accomplish.
====================
Ban the sale of assault weapons.
====================
The Saudi regime murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critic, for being outspoken about the Saudi regime's repression of Yemenis.
====================
Yesterday, I attended a town meeting in Erie to discuss the expanding of the child tax credit. If you missed it, tune in now.
====================
After years of lies and evasion, the Trump administration is finally admitting that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm. Let’s be very clear: this crisis is not over. 

Trump and his friends are using climate change as an excuse to kill the Affordable Care Act.
====================
President Trump now has a choice: will he follow his own party's lead and defend the status quo, or will Congress stand with the working class and protect their interests? Or will he continue the attacks on the working class and the Constitution?
====================
Thousands of doctors, nurses, firefighters and EMT's have died because they were forced to work without masks, gloves, feeding tubes or medical equipment.

I cannot comprehend what is going on here.
====================
Tonight at 7 PM ET we will present a live town hall event on the Iran nuclear deal, with @SenWarren, @MarkRuffalo and @RepDarrenSoto. Tune in:
====================
Childhood poverty costs at least $500 billion annually in extra education, health and criminal justice expenses, and in lost productivity.

That is unacceptable.

We must invest in our kids and future generations.
====================
Happy #CowAppreciationDay.
====================
Big banks know stealing money from the poor and working class is a death sentence. Using their enormous wealth and power to take lives is an outrage.
====================
How great is an American economy in which people suddenly go into desperation if they don't receive a check for a week or two?

We need to take a deep breath and say: All people deserve economic security. You've got a job, then you must earn a living wage, not a starvation wage.
====================
We have very little time to save American democracy from Trump and his religious bigotry.

But we have a lot of work to do if we are to build a country that is truly welcoming of all people regardless of their faith.
====================
Trump and Ted Cruz love to say that they’ll protect Americans with pre-exisiting conditions. So why do they keep pushing policies that do the opposite?
====================
Hoping for a full recovery for Red Sox great David "Big Papi" Ortiz, one of the most outstanding and popular baseball players in recent memory.
====================
The very rich get richer.

The working class gets poorer.

In my view, this bill should not be happening without the American people's help.

I am proud to work with the American people to make sure they get what they paid for—and that their help is taken care of.
====================
How can a vibrant democracy be allowed to fall prey to the same people who want endless war?
====================
Our democracy is under severe attack from right-wing extremists.

Our job: fight back

Our job now: create millions of jobs in the fight for living standards that the American people want.
====================
Donald Trump has been a pathological liar for saying the U.S. government failed nearly every test they asked him to administer.

Now he's lying about 50 times about the government's success.

We must defeat Trump's pathological lying and evasion.
====================
Medicare for All means:

✅ No copays
✅ No deductibles
✅ Freedom of choice in doctors and hospitals
✅ Coverage for every American

The function of our current system is to make more money for the insurance and drug companies. That is what instability looks like.
====================
The Saudi regime murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critic, in their own consulate. A month later, they execute and maims another Egyptian journalist, Farhan Mohmande.
====================
We can begin to end the international disgrace of being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave as a right.
====================
It's disgraceful that Trump deployed American troops into harm's way to guard Syrian oil wells. This kind of militarism is incompatible with our values and with American values, which is why Trump must be defeated.
====================
The President has left the House of Representatives no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. I will be filing impeachment charges against Trump here on Capitol Hill with a subpoena for documents.
====================
